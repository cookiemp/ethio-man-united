## 🐛 Known Behaviors

### **Expected Behaviors:**
1. **Page refresh after reply:** This is intentional to show the new reply immediately
2. **No real-time updates:** Replies won't appear automatically without refresh (feature for later)
3. **Reply count updates:** Happens in database, will show on next page load

### **Not Bugs:**
- Reply form requires login (intentional security measure)
- Page refreshes after submission (ensures data consistency)
- Server-side rendering means initial load is fast but requires refresh for updates

---

## 🚨 What to Watch For (Potential Issues)

### **If Something Goes Wrong:**

#### **Issue: Can't see any forum posts**
**Fix:** 
```bash
# Create a test post via /forum/create
# Or check Firestore rules are deployed
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

#### **Issue: Reply submission fails**
**Check:**
1. User is logged in
2. Firestore rules allow authenticated writes
3. Browser console for specific errors
4. Firebase console → Firestore for data

#### **Issue: 404 on forum detail page**
**Causes:**
- Post doesn't exist in Firestore
- Using old mock data ID from before migration
- Solution: Create new post via /forum/create

#### **Issue: Reply doesn't appear after submission**
**Check:**
1. Page actually refreshed?
2. Check Firestore console for the reply document
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify subcollection path: `forum_posts/{postId}/replies`

---

## 📊 Database Verification

Fields:
- title: string
- content: string

- authorId: string
- replyCount: number (should increment)
- createdAt: timestamp
- updatedAt: timestamp (updates with each reply)
```

#### **Reply Document:**
```
Collection: forum_posts/{postId}/replies
Document ID: {auto-generated}
