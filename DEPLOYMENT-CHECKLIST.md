- [x] Environment variables set (.env.local)
- [x] Production build tested

### ⚠️ Known Warnings (Non-blocking)

- Firebase initialization warnings during build - **Expected behavior, works in production**
- Custom font warning - **Minor, doesn't affect site**

---

## Configuration Needed Before First Use

### 1. Admin Account
**Important**: Set your admin credentials in:
```
src/lib/auth.ts
```
Look for:
```typescript
const ADMIN_USERNAME = 'admin';
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'your-secure-password-here'; // Change this!
```

**Action Required**: 
- Change the password to something secure
- Don't commit the new password to GitHub

### 2. API Football Key
Your API key is already in `.env.local`:
```
FOOTBALL_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
Make sure you have API credits remaining.

### 3. Firestore Rules
Already deployed! ✅
- Public read access for content
- Authenticated write for users
- Admin check at application level

---

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Firebase Hosting (Recommended)

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Build the production app
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy
```

**What gets deployed:**
- Next.js app to Firebase Hosting
- Firestore rules
- Storage rules (if you enable Storage later)

**URL**: Will be `https://your-project-id.web.app`

### Option 2: Vercel (Alternative)

**Steps:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

**Pros**: 
- Easier CI/CD
- Free SSL
- Global CDN
- Serverless functions

**Note**: Will still use Firebase for database/auth

### Option 3: Other Hosting

Can deploy to:
- Netlify
- AWS Amplify
- Google Cloud Run
- Your own VPS

---

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### 1. First Login
```
URL: https://yourdomain.com/admin/login
Username: admin
Password: [your secure password]
```

### 2. Create First Content
1. Add a news article with thumbnail
2. Configure "Watch Live" URL in settings
3. Test forum post creation
4. Approve a test comment

### 3. Test User Flow
1. Sign up as a regular user
2. Create a forum post
3. Add a comment to news
4. Edit your profile

### 4. Set Up Your Domain (Optional)
- Firebase Hosting supports custom domains
- Add your domain in Firebase Console
- Update DNS records

---

## Environment Variables Needed

Make sure these are set in production:

```env
# .env.local (for local dev)
# These need to be set in your hosting provider too

FOOTBALL_API_KEY=your_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=studio-1460723099-b75c7
# ... (other Firebase config is in src/firebase/config.ts)
```

---

## Security Reminders

### ✅ Already Implemented
- Firestore security rules deployed
- Admin authentication via cookies
- HTTPS enforced (Firebase/Vercel auto-provides)
- Input sanitization
- XSS protection via React

### ⚠️ Important Notes
1. **Settings Collection**: Currently open for writes (admin check at app level)
   - Consider restricting further if site grows
2. **Admin Password**: Change default password immediately
3. **API Keys**: Never commit .env.local to GitHub
4. **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented yet (add if abuse occurs)

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### What to Monitor
1. **Firebase Usage**: Check Firebase Console daily
   - Firestore reads/writes
   - Storage usage
   - Authentication users

2. **API Football Quota**: Check API credits
   - Most plans have rate limits
   - Cache match data if needed

3. **Error Logs**: Check Firebase Functions logs
   - Look for failed API calls
   - Monitor authentication errors

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Weekly: Check Firebase usage stats
- [ ] Weekly: Review pending comments
- [ ] Monthly: Update dependencies (`npm update`)
- [ ] Monthly: Check for security updates

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Pagination**: 
   - Client-side only (costs increase with users)
   - Consider SSR for > 1000 daily users

2. **Match Data**: 
   - No caching (fresh on every load)
   - May hit API rate limits with many users

3. **Settings Security**: 
   - Anyone can theoretically write to settings collection
   - Protected by admin check at app level only

4. **No Avatar Uploads**: 
   - Removed to avoid Firebase Storage setup
   - Can add back later if needed

---

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

```bash
# View previous deployments
firebase hosting:rollback

# Or redeploy from a previous commit
git checkout <previous-commit>
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

---

## Cost Estimates

### Firebase Free Tier (Spark Plan)
- ✅ Hosting: 10GB storage, 360MB/day transfer
- ✅ Firestore: 50K reads, 20K writes, 1GB storage per day
- ✅ Authentication: Unlimited users
- ✅ Storage: Not enabled (no cost)

### Expected Costs (Based on Usage)
- **0-1000 users**: $0/month (free tier covers it)
- **1000-5000 users**: $1-5/month (minor Firestore overages)
- **5000-10000 users**: $5-20/month (without optimization)

### Ways to Reduce Costs
1. Implement SSR (server-side rendering)
2. Add Redis caching
3. Optimize Firestore queries
4. Add indexes to speed up queries
