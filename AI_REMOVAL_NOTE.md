# AI Features Removed

**Date:** October 8, 2025

## Summary

All AI/Genkit-related features have been removed from the project as they are not needed for this Manchester United fan community website.

## What Was Removed

### Dependencies Uninstalled
- `@genkit-ai/google-genai` - Google Gemini AI integration
- `@genkit-ai/next` - Genkit Next.js adapter
- `genkit` - Core Genkit library
- `genkit-cli` - Genkit CLI tools

**Result:** Removed 450 packages, reduced bundle size significantly

### Files Deleted
- `src/ai/` directory (entire folder)
  - `src/ai/genkit.ts` - Genkit configuration
  - `src/ai/dev.ts` - AI development server

### Scripts Removed
- `genkit:dev` - Start AI development server
- `genkit:watch` - Start AI server with watch mode

### Documentation Updated
- Removed AI Integration section from `CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md`
- Updated scripts list to reflect current state
- Removed Genkit references from project structure

## Verification

After removal:
- ✅ `npm audit` - 0 vulnerabilities
- ✅ `npm run typecheck` - No errors
- ✅ `npm run lint` - Pass (2 warnings only)
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ All features work without AI dependencies

## Impact

**Before:**
- 1,093 total packages
- AI features taking up space
- Peer dependency conflicts with Next.js

**After:**
- 646 total packages (~40% reduction)
- Cleaner dependency tree
- No peer dependency conflicts
- Faster install times

## Why This Is Good

1. **Simpler Project** - No unnecessary complexity
2. **Faster Builds** - Fewer dependencies to process
3. **Smaller Bundle** - Less code shipped to users
4. **Better Maintenance** - Fewer packages to update/secure
5. **Clear Purpose** - Project focused solely on community features

---

The project is now streamlined and focused on its core purpose: a Manchester United fan community website with news, fixtures, forum, and admin features.
