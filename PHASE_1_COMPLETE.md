## ⚠️ Known Considerations

### Build Warnings (Non-Breaking)
1. **Font Warning:** Custom fonts in `layout.tsx` - This is expected with App Router
2. **Firebase Warning:** During build, Firebase tries to auto-init (expected behavior)
3. **useMemo Warning:** In `firebase/provider.tsx` - Can be ignored (works correctly)

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Add pagination for news articles (when count > 20)
- [ ] Add rich text editor (currently plain textarea)
- [ ] Add categories/tags for articles
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Add bulk comment moderation actions
- [ ] Add article draft/publish status
