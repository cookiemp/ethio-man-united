## üîí Updated Firestore Rules (Phase 2)

// Forum posts - authenticated users can create, admin approves
match /forum_posts/{postId} {
  allow get, list: if true;
  allow create: if isSignedIn() && request.resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid;
  allow update: if isSignedIn(); // For admin approval
  allow delete: if isSignedIn(); // For admin deletion
  
  // Forum replies
  match /replies/{replyId} {
    allow get, list: if true;
    allow create: if isSignedIn() && request.resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid;
    allow update, delete: if isSignedIn();
  }
}

// User profiles
match /users/{userId} {
  allow get, list: if true;
  allow create: if isSignedIn() && request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow update: if isSignedIn() && request.auth.uid == userId;

## üé® UI Components Needed

2. **ForumCategoryBadge** - Show category with color coding
3. **ReplySection** - Reply form and list (similar to comments)
4. **UserMenu** - Dropdown with profile/logout

## üö® Potential Challenges

### **Challenge 1: Forum Reply Threading**
**Problem:** Nested replies can be complex  
**Solution:** Start with flat reply structure (no nested replies), add threading later if needed

### **Challenge 2: User Auth State Management**
**Problem:** Managing auth state across components  
**Solution:** Use Firebase Auth's `onAuthStateChanged` in a context provider

### **Challenge 3: Real-time Data Updates**
**Problem:** Users expect instant updates for new posts/replies  
**Solution:** Use Firestore real-time listeners for forum pages

### **Challenge 4: Football API Rate Limits**
**Problem:** Free APIs have strict limits  
**Solution:** Cache responses aggressively, refresh every 15-30 minutes
