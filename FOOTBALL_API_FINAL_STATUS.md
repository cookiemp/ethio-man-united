## 📊 Current Configuration

### **Season Used:**
- **2023** (which is the 2023-2024 season)
- Runs from July 2023 to May 2024
- Last match: Man City 1-2 Man United (FA Cup Final, May 25, 2024)

### **Why 2023 Season?**
The **free tier of API-Football** has limitations:
- ❌ No access to current season (2024-2025)
- ❌ No `next` parameter for upcoming fixtures
- ❌ No `last` parameter for recent results
- ✅ **But seasons 2021, 2022, 2023 ARE supported!**

We're using **season 2023** which gives us the most recent available data within free tier limits.

## 🌐 How to View

### **Fixtures Page:**
Visit: **http://localhost:9002/fixtures**

You'll see:
- Blue info banner explaining it's 2023-2024 season data
- Two tabs: "2023-24 Fixtures" and "2023-24 Results"
- Real team logos
- Match venues and dates
- Competition badges (Premier League, FA Cup, etc.)

### **Homepage:**

## 🔍 What Changed to Make It Work

### 1. **Fixed Season Parameter**
```typescript
// Before: 
export const CURRENT_SEASON = 2024; // ❌ Not available in free tier

// After:
export const CURRENT_SEASON = 2023; // ✅ Available and has full data!
```

### 2. **Removed Unsupported Parameters**
```typescript
// Before:
const endpoint = `/fixtures?team=33&next=10`; // ❌ Free tier doesn't support 'next'

// After:
const endpoint = `/fixtures?team=33&season=2023`; // ✅ Works perfectly!
```

### 3. **Smart Filtering Logic**
- Fetches all 61 fixtures from season 2023
- Filters for completed matches (FT, AET, PEN)
- Sorts by date (newest first)
- Returns top 10 results

### 4. **User Communication**
- Added clear notice that this is 2023-2024 season data
- Updated tab labels to show "2023-24"
- Changed default tab to "Results" (more impressive!)
